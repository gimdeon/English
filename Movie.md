# [Theme] Movie
## My favorite movie
**Genre**
I like a Hollywood blockbuster movie. Computer graphics, car chasing and explosions. I think these spectacle scene make a movie worth watchable.
I like heroe's movies like a Iron man or Spider man or James bonds. 
**Favorite**
And my favorite movie is the End game. A few month ago, the Dark night was my favorite. But after I watched the End game, I changed my mind. Of course the Dark night is a good movie too. And I like the director, Christopher Nolan yet.
**About Movie**
Anyway the End game was really moving and awesome, and it has a very well-structured plot. The story contains last series scenes, so I recalled my memories during watching movie. I was like “Oh, this scene is Thor, 2 years `ago and that scene is Civil War, 3 years ago”. Actors are getting older, and I’m too. The first time I’ve seen the Avenges’s series is 11 years ago. It was the Iron man. And after that, I’ve watched most of the series.
**Favorite Character**
My favorite character is Iron man. I think many people like him. He always get his way, so he look like he’s selfish. But every important moment he acts for other people and saves people. I think he is really attractive.
**Result**
I don't usually watch movie twice, because I think it is boring to watch movie after knowing the result. But I’ve seen twice. I really want recommend to you.
