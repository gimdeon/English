## English
**Past**
I have studied English for a long time. The first time I studied english was in middle school. At that time I just studied it for a exam. Not funny, Not interested in. So my grade was not good.
**Realize**
As time went by, I realized that English is really important than I thought. It could give me more opportunities and knowledge. But I can’t speak English well, so I think I missed many opportunities and I was behind in knowledges.
**Try and Fail**
I’ve tried to many things to improve my English skill. I’ve went to the English classes or read the English books. But I was still not interested in learning English, so gave up and did it again and again. I think my main cause of failure was that I thought the English was the sort of exam. It made me feel like bored. And I’m not a talkative person, so I couldn’t speak English well  because there was a little things I wanted to say.
**Now**
So recently I try to find something I’m interested in. And write a diary to express my thought and my emotion.
**Future**
If it possible I want to get a new job in abroad. And If I can speak English fluently, I want to learn another language, the Chinese. I think when I find the way to improve my English skill, I can learn another language in the same way,  more easily.

## Malta
**Why**
My company give a long vacation to a long-term employee. I have been working for 9 years, so I got two month vacation. At first, I just wanna travel to somewhere. But I thought I don’t want to waste my time. So I decide to study english for my vacation. I searched other countries for studying english. Philippine was a candidate place. But someone recommended Malta to me. 
**How**
So I plan to go to the Malta and I enroll English institute. The English institute have a dormitory, so I will stay there and I will share the room with other people.
**My emotion**
It is a first time to travel alone, so I am little nerves. I am worry about missing airplane and getting lost anywhere, speaking English.
But on the other hand, I am happy. Because I have overworked since last month. I usually leave the office at mid-night. I am tired and I need to relax now.
